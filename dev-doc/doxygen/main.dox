The main goal of this proof of concept project is to answer some questions where writting numerical simulations :
   - When starting we decide a memory layout wich may not be optimal at then end with new features support. How to change it easily ?
   - On current architecture, efficient usage of cluster maye require cache blocking, communication overlapping, vectorisation, usage of optimized libraries... How to manage all those questions while 
hard codding things directely in C ?
   - People working on math are not expert in computer science and vise versa, how to deal with those two required capabilities ?
